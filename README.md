# Managing-System
This is an overview of a system capable of saving userdata in a local database for the creation of new accounts and signing up into the app,
Avoiding data redundancy, encrypting new passwords with a cypher making each one unique, and sending automatic emails to justify the creation of a new account or change of password.
This is all done in java for personal use and understanding of the language. 
A web app will be done later on to complete the interface.
Updates are coming each week as from December
